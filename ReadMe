current challenges:
unable to output packerAMI iD to Terraform
I want to write a shell script that would run packer (build AMI) and then run terraform so don't have to run cmds manually
I am unable to build AmazonLinux2 AMI with Packer [had to use bootstrap files]

clarification:
Am I installing Grafana on my Ubuntu [build] machine? the task said to install Jenkins
